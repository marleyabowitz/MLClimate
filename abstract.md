Project Proposal: Machine Learning-Based Wildfire Risk Prediction in California

Introduction
Wildfires in California have become increasingly frequent and severe due to a combination of climate change, land-use patterns, and environmental conditions. Predicting the likelihood of wildfires in advance can enhance disaster preparedness, improve resource allocation, and inform mitigation strategies. This project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model that assesses wildfire risk in California counties by analyzing key environmental factors.

Objective
The primary goal of this research is to build a predictive algorithm using machine learning techniques to estimate the probability of wildfire occurrence in a given county. By leveraging historical wildfire data and relevant environmental features, this model aims to provide an early warning score that can support wildfire prevention and response efforts.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Wildfire occurrence data will be sourced from publicly available datasets such as the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), and NASA FIRMS.

Features under consideration include...
- Climatic factors: Precipitation levels, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and drought severity indices.
- Historical fire data: Frequency, severity, and extent of past wildfires.
- Land and vegetation characteristics: Vegetation type, soil moisture, fuel load, and land cover classifications.
- Temporal factors: Seasonality and time of year.

Machine Learning Model Selection and Training
A variety of supervised learning algorithms will be tested, including:
Random Forest (RF): To capture complex feature interactions and assess variable importance.
Na√Øve Bayes (NB): To evaluate probabilistic dependencies between environmental factors.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): To classify high-risk versus low-risk conditions.
The dataset will be split into training, validation, and testing sets using an 80-10-10% split.
Model performance will be evaluated based on classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

Feature Engineering and Optimization
Feature selection techniques such as mutual information, correlation analysis, and SHAP values will be used to identify the most influential predictors.
Hyperparameter tuning will be conducted using grid search and cross-validation to optimize model performance.
Interpretability and Deployment

Feature importance analysis will be performed to provide insights into the key drivers of wildfire risk.
The final model may be integrated into a GIS-based visualization tool or a web dashboard to display real-time risk scores for different counties.

Expected Outcome
A machine learning model capable of predicting wildfire risk based on historical and environmental data.
Identification of key environmental variables that contribute to wildfire likelihood.
Potential recommendations for wildfire management strategies based on predictive insights.

This project aims to contribute to the field of climate-informed disaster prediction by developing a data-driven approach to wildfire forecasting. Future extensions of this work could involve incorporating deep learning models, real-time satellite data integration, and collaborative efforts with fire management agencies for field validation.
