Wildfires are a recurring and intensifying threat in California, caused by complex interactions between climate, land, and human activity. This project develops a machine learning (ML) pipeline to asses the efficacy of different models abilities to predict weekly fire occurrences in California from 2014 to 2024, using a custom-built dataset that integrates environmental variables at a spatial resolution of (0.1° x 0.1° grid cells). Multiple ML models were trained and evaluated, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and a Multi- Layer Perceptron. Ensemble approaches and a confidence-aware classification strategy yielded the highest performance, with F1 scores exceeding 0.90 and ROC AUC near 0.99. Feature importance analysis using SHAP and tree-based models identified wind speed, temperature, and recent fire history as the most predictive factors. This work highlights the potential of interpretable, data-driven models in supporting proactive wildfire management and lays the groundwork for future efforts for creating spatiotemporal environmental datasets and predicting fire risk in real-time.
