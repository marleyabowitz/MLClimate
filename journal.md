Diary of progress. 
It contains dated entries with a description of what you are doing, what you found, what you are thinking, and so on. 
It is mainly a resource for you, but I will glance at it too (at the end of the semester). 
Please update and commit it at least once per week.

Week of February 17th: 
- Decide on project theme
- Chose data sets
