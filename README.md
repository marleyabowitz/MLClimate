This project is composed of two parts: dataset creation and ML pipeline.
For the creation of the data set, I created intermitten csv files after adding each individual variable
with a python script. I have not included the intermittent csv files, so some of the dataset scripts 
won't run without them. As such, to use this code to create a dataset, you will need to run them all from
start to finish to create each intermittent csv file. Fortunately this is not necessary as I have provided the
final dataset to test the ML pipeline on.
